<a href="/files/sze_waiting_jmp.pdf" > The Dynamics of Co-Residence, Wealth, and Family Formation (JMP)</a>

Parental co-residence has become an increasingly popular choice for young adults. This paper examines how co-residence status influences net worth and family formation decisions. Using dynamic event studies, I analyze outcomes around a move into and out of the parental home. An instrumental variable (IV) approach is employed to estimate the causal effects of co-residence on expected household formation. While the event studies reveal no significant net worth differences between co-residing and non-co-residing young adults, moving out is positively associated with a higher likelihood of marriage and larger family sizes. For the IV analysis, predicted state unaffordability is used as an instrument for co-residence. The findings offer insights into the complex relationship between living arrangements, financial well-being, and household formation.


<a href="/files/third-year-paper.pdf" > Parental Co-Residence and Asset Accumulation </a>

This paper develops and solves a model to examine how young adultsâ€™ savings decisions are affected by co-residence and student loan payments. Co-residence is typically chosen by individuals are younger and have lower incomes, making it more challenging for them to save compared to those who do not co-reside. Additionally, young adults are more likely to co-reside when housing costs are high and their preference for independent living is low. The model predicts that without the obligation of rental payments, the extra savings during co-residence are used to pay off student loans.

Parental Co-Residence and Marital Transitions (In Progress)

A structural model is built to examine the relationship between parental co-residence and marriage timing. I study how living arrangements may delay marriage, incorporating housing costs, preferences for independence, and match quality.
